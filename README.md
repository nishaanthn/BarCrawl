Checkpoint 3: Core Algorithm Testing
------------------------------------
<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>If you would like to test out BarCrawl, simply follow these few steps:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Open the "Twitter Crawler" folder</li>
  <li>Download all of the files in the "Twitter_Streaming" folder</li>
  <li>Open the terminal and locate the folder where the files you downloaded are located</li>
  <li>Run the code simply with "python Tweet_Crawler.py"</li> 
  </ul>  
<p>After you have done this, you are ready to listen for people tweeting about the bars in College Station. 
The results will be displayed on the console telling you that tweet has been collected and which bar was tweeted at
If you would like to see immediate results, you can simply tweet at our team member Nish (@nishaanthn) and watch it 
appear on your console! </p>
